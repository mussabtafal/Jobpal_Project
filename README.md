Hi There !! 
This is our very first Python project and we are very proud about it.

# Jobpal
## So, What is Jobpal ?
A web application with the main purpose of exchanging information between Job seekers and recruiters about the local market job needs and available opportunities, users of the platform will be able to register, apply for jobs, add jobs, get job details and statistics, the job seeker will be able to log all the applied jobs while the recruiter will be able to log all the received application and filter them by either accepting the application or rejecting it, the recruiter will be required to send feedback to the rejected applicant specifying the reason of rejection.

## The Story Behind the name ?
The name of the Website came from 2 words __Job__  from the main purpose of the website and __Palestine__  to refer to the location the website serves, we added both words and smashed the B with P, The result was this very beautiful Logo.

## Functionality ?
Users of the website can register as Companies or as Jobseekrs
based on how the user registered a set of different features can be accessed such as adding jobs, applying for jobs, accepting and rejecting clients, filtering and browsing jobs using the search bar or the filter bar.

## About us ? 
This Website was designed by three enthusiastic junior Web-Devlopers, The idea of JobPal came from the need for a platform where Job opportunities can be offered and exchanged. We encourage all the users of the platform to reach out to all the companies registered on the website. Life is all about opportunities. We hope that this Website will be the seed for all Job seekers who are trying to find a place to belong, a place where people can grow professionally and reflect on their Careers, We wish you all the luck in the world !
